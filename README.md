# Fair Implicit Path  (ICML-2022)


# Intro

A pytorch implementation of [Fair Representation Learning through Implicit Path Alignment.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13316)

We consider learning a fair representation through learning invariant optimal predictor, on the top of predefined representation. 
We further fromulate the problem as a bi-level optimization and formally justify the learned representation satisfying the sufficiency rule.
